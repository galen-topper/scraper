    "bio": "BioI am Jijumon, a biologist, mostly trained in molecular biology, cell biology, and protein biochemistry. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in Manu Prakash's lab at Stanford University. I did my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Biological Sciences at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research-Kolkata (IISER-K). After that, I moved to Europe and worked in the BRC, Hungarian Academy of Sciences as an ITC fellow. There I did a one-year training course on contemporary experimental biology and state-of-the-art techniques, together with a project in sarcomeric actin regulation. In 2016, I moved to Paris and started my Ph.D. in Biological Sciences (Marie Curie fellow) in Carsten Janke's lab at Institut Curie, University of Paris-Saclay. My broader research interests are cytoskeleton, tool development, and proteomics. I use both biochemical and bioengineering tools to tackle my project. Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy activities such as reading, photography, shuttle badminton, and cycling."
